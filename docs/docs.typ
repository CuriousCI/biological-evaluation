== Introduction

#proj-name is a tool meant to help study the likelihood of a given situation in
a biological system.

Given a set of _target species_, a set of constraints on the _target species_
(constraints which model a situation that could present, for example, in a
disease) and by taking into account all the reactions within a set _target
    pathways_ that lead to the production, both directly and indirectly, of the
_target species_, the goal is to find a subset of virtual patients for the
described situation.

#TODO[
    find papers in literature that do similar things; what does this method add
    compared to other approaches? (i.e. using multiple pathways by generating
    the fixed point, ensemble of SAs etc...)
]

#TODO[add case study, multiple if possible]

#pagebreak()

== Requirements

The basic idea behind the software is to take the description of a model (with
_target species_, _target pathways_, constraints on the _target species_, and
the parameters $epsilon, delta in (0, 1)$ for the evalation of the constraints),
to generate a SBML model with
- all the reactions within the _target pathways_ that, both directly and
    indirectly, generate the _target species_
- parameters for the reactions' speeds
- structural constraints on the reactions' speeds (some reactions are faster
    than others) #TODO[I still haven't figured out how to get that information
        out of Reactome, maybe I just have to search more]
- constraints on the quantities of the entities (for which the model needs to be
    simulated)

#TODO[
    possibly take a configuration file as input, maybe PEtab could be good,
    otherwise `JSON` should be enough, as everything else is generated
    automatically from Reactome, the model should work with both StableIDVersion
    and ReactomeDbId;

    The #logic[TargetPathway]s should be optional. The ExtraConstraints should
    be optional. The PreferredCompartmentForSimulation could be specified.

The idea is to expand a portion of Reactome

    - $S$ is the transitive closure of $S_I$ within the Reactome graph (to be
        more precise, the closure within the specified bounds, bounds yet to be

== Interval

The #logic[Interval] type represents an open interval in $RR$ of the type
$(#logic[min], #logic[max])$ s.t.
- when #logic[min] is not defined, it is interpreted as $-infinity$
- when #logic[max] is not defined, it is interpreted as $+infinity$

#constraint(
    [C.Interval.min_leq_max],
    ```
    forall interval, interval_min, interval_max
        (
            Interval(interval) and
            min(interval, interval_min) and
            max(interval, interval_max)
        ) ->
            interval_min <= interval_max
    ```,
)

== ReactomeDbId

This is required because not all instances of #logic[DatabaseObject] in Reactome
have a #logic[StableIdVersion], which is the one usually displayed in the
Reactome Pathway Browser @reactome-pathway-browser. Instances of
#logic[DatabaseObject] in Reactome can be identified with a
#logic[ReactomeDbId], but its pattern does not match the definition of
#logic[SId] used to identify objects in SBML.

In order to generate a correct #logic[SBMLModel] the #logic[ReactomeDbId] must
be converted into a #logic[SId].

#operation(
    [ReactomeDbId_into_SId],
    args: [db_id: ReactomeDbId],
    type: [SId],
    post: [. . .],
)

== StableIdVersion

The #logic[StableIdVersion] type is useful because is the one usually displayed
in the Reactome Pathway Browser @reactome-pathway-browser. It is useful to
accept it in the description of the models.

The #logic[StableIdVersion] type is used to identify instances of
#logic[PhysicalEntity] or #logic[Event] in Reactome, but it's pattern does not
match the definition of #logic[SId] used to identify objects in SBML.

In order to generate a correct #logic[SBMLModel] the #logic[StableId] must be
converted.

    [StableIdVersion_into_SId],

    type: [SId],

== CatalystActivity

The role of #logic[PhysicalEntity] in #logic[_catalyst_activity_entity_] has
multiplicity #logic[0..\*] because _"If a #logic[PhysicalEntity] can enable
    multiple molecular functions, a separate #logic[CatalystActivity] instance
    is created for each"_ #ref(<data-model-glossary>, supplement: [Page 5]).

An additional constraint is required for active units, because _"If the
    #logic[PhysicalEntity] is a #logic[Complex] and a component of the complex
    mediates the molecular function, that component should be identified as the
    active unit of the #logic[CatalystActivity]."_ #ref(
    <data-model-glossary>,
    supplement: [Page 5],
)

// TODO: does it expand to multiple level complexes?

#constraint(
    [C.CatalystActivity.active_unit_is_component_of_complex],
    ```
    forall catalyst_activity, complex, complex_component
        (
            CatalystActivity(catalyst_activity) and
            Complex(complex) and
            PhysicalEntity(complex_component) and
            *catalyst_activity_entity*(catalyst_activity, complex) and
            *catalyst_activity_active_unit*(
                catalyst_activity,
                complex_component
            )
        ) ->
            *complex_has_component_entity*(complex, complex_component)
    ```,
)

== Compartment

// #TODO[move this information to the #logic[_compartment_entity_] association, or
//     to #logic[PreferredCompartmentForSimulation]]

The #logic[Compartment] class has some quirks. In Reactome, the
#logic[Compartment]'s role in the #logic[_compartment_entity_] association has
multiplicity #logic[0..\*]. The problem is that the SBML model requires
#logic[1..1] multiplicity for this association to be simulated.

In Reactome there are currently (TODO: version??) 19 physical entities which
don't have a compartment (see queries/helper.cypher), so this can be easily
solved by just adding a *default compartment* to the SBML model to which these
entities map to.

On the other hand there are 14046 entities which have multiple compartments
(TODO: how many compartments has each exactly?), so the easiest choice right now
is to just pick any of them. For this reason the


// TODO: actual model requires 1..1 compartments for PhysicalEntity
//
// - if no compartment is present just use a default one
// - if multiple compartments are present use whichever you want (for now)

== Pathway

The instances of #logic[Pathway] are organized hierarchically, i.e. all the
signaling pathways are collected under the Signal Transduction top level
#logic[Pathway] (#logic[StableIdVersion] R-HSA-162582.13). This allows to easily
extract a subset of reactions by specifying the _target pathways_ in a model and
taking into consideration only the reactions which are included, both directly
or indirectly, in that pathway (see the #logic[included_reactions()] operation).

Ignoring the #logic[_inferred_to_ association] there are about 34 top level
pathways.
