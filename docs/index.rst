bsys documentation
==================

BSYS-eval is a tool meant to help study the likelihood of a given scenario in a
biological system.

Given a set of **target species**, a set of constraints on the **target species**
(constraints which model a scenario that could present, for example, in a
disease) and by taking into account all the reactions within a set **target pathways** 
that lead to the production, both directly and indirectly, of the
**target species**, the goal is to find a subset of virtual patients for the
described scenario.
