# bsys-eval

bsys-eval is a tool meant to help study the likelihood of a given scenario in
a biological system.

Given a set of _target species_, a set of constraints on the _target species_
(constraints which model a scenario that could present, for example, in a
disease) and by taking into account all the reactions that lead to the
production, both directly and indirectly, of the _target species_, the goal is
to find a subset of virtual patients for the situation.
